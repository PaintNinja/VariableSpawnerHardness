Default spawner hardnesses
--------------------------
Peaceful: Same hardness as vanilla (5F)
Easy: Same as end stone (9F)
Normal: Same as ender chests (22.5F)
Hard: Same as ancient debris (30F)
Hardcore: Same as obsidian (50F)

The spawner hardnesses are configurable in the variablespawnerhardness-common.toml file.

Unlike some of the blocks mentioned above, you can still destroy a spawner with any tool you want as long as you don't use your bare hands.'''
